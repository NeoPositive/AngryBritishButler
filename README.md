# Lethal Company: "Angry British" Butler Audio Overhaul, the true British Butler!

### NOTE: AUDIO OVERLAP CAN HAPPEN.

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Angry British" Butler Audio Overhaul for Lethal Company! This mod replaces some audio of the butler and replaces it with a much more funny and more british-er audio that should perfectly capsulize London and the UK.

### **Audio Variety**:

- This mod adds 28 audio replacements to enhance the Butler into a patriotic Brit!
- There is 13 diffrent phrases that the butler can say when they brandishing their knife out!
- There is another 13 different phrases that the butler can say while brushing the floor!
- There is also 2 songs that could play while the butler is chasing you!

## Installation
Size = ~5.31 MB (mostly due to the songs)

1. **Download Mod Files**: Get the mod files from the provided link or by the Thunderstore mod launcher.

2. **Launch the Game**: Start Lethal Company and get ready to face the butlers with a British twist!

## Compatibility

This mod is designed to work seamlessly with the latest version of Lethal Company. Ensure your game is up to date for optimal performance - or it may just suck due to my incompentence.

## Roadmap

- I will **try** my hardest to reduce any overlap with any of the audio (however none seems impossible due to it relying on RNG..)
- I do plan on making the other monsters into *British* varients. 

## Credits

A massive shoutout to the BBCC (Clive, Molegrip and of course, Fraz) for the amazing audio that they've provided and have been used for this mod!

Another shoutout to HoffmanTV for creating the angry british hoarding bug mod and providing the inspiration for this mod to be created.

First person that I've seen use the mod is **@jenvonlee** on TikTok so I would like to give them a shoutout.
