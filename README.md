# Lethal Company: "Angry British" Butler Audio Overhaul.

### NOTE: I HAVE NOT EXTENSIVELY PLAYTESTED THIS MOD YET AND STILL IS IN DEVELOPMENT.

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Angry British" Butler Audio Overhaul for Lethal Company! This mod replaces some audio of the butler and replaces it with a much more funny and more british-er audio that should perfectly capsulize London.

### **Audio Variety**:

- There is a total of 26 different phrases that the butler can say in game with this mod!
- There is 13 diffrent phrases that the butler can say when they brandishing their knife out!
- There is another 13 different phrases that the butler can say while brushing the floor!

## Installation

1. **Download Mod Files**: Get the mod files from the provided link or by the Thunderstore mod launcher.

2. **Launch the Game**: Start Lethal Company and get ready to face the butlers with a British twist!

## Compatibility

This mod is designed to work seamlessly with the latest version of Lethal Company. Ensure your game is up to date for optimal performance - or it may just suck due to my incompentence.

## Roadmap

- I will soon enough **try** to aim to having no overlap with any of the audio (as none seems impossible due to RNG..)
- I will add *Minuet* to replace the ButlerMurderTheme eventually. 

## Credits

A massive shoutout to the BBCC (Clive, Molegrip and of course, Fraz) for the amazing audio that they've provided and have been used for this mod!

Another shoutout to HoffmanTV for creating the angry british hoarding bug mod and providing the inspiration for this mod to be created - and also providing the backbone of this mod.
